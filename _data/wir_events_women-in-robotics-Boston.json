    "description": "<div>Hey everyone, it's been a while since we last talked and our community has grown since then. Let's catch up and get to know more about each other, welcome our new members in the group and see what everyone's been up to. Share our thoughts, ideas, inspirations, hybrid/back-to-office routines and issues in robotics. This is a casual conversation to know what all cool projects our fellow roboticists are working on, ask questions, and just have some fun.  If you are interested in organizing events with amazing women in the field to inspire and encourage more women to join the field of robotics, do join us for our upcoming casual talk.<br><strong>Let's talk robotics! </strong></div>",
