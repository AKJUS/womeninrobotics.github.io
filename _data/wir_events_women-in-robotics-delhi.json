    "description": "<div>Greetings, Robotics Enthusiastss! <br>Robotics is a thriving industry We know the demand for robotics developers is growing, but there are not enough developers with the knowledge to program robots. This is your chance to stand out among the rest of the world’s engineers. If you jump on the wagon of robotics development now, you will have a clear advantage over other developers. <br>We're planning our first introductory event, where all roboticists can meet and talk about their future goals. This event is open to anyone (of any gender) interested in learning Robotics. We'll talk about the future of robotics, as well as the diversity of different professions within robotics.</div>",
